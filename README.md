Augusta Rise / single page application

--- Synopsis / Summary ---

Existing client Barrett Homes needed a new single page website in order to promote a housing development located in Omokoroa. It was important that this website had an autonomous look & feel in relation to the main Barrett Homes brand as other construction companies would be listing houses in the development. A lightweight application was required that could be highly optimised for Google Search.
